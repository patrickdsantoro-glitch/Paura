Ideas for puzzles for the game
Clock puzzle - for every hour in the game, the grandfather clock chimes, ringing throughout the halls, this results in the randomization of the house. For example, if there are 10 hallways, and a total of 25 rooms, hallway 1 has 3 doors and a door leading to a new hallway, the 3 doors lead to rooms 4, 8, and 15,and the hallway door leads to hallway 7, when the clock chimes, hallway 1 now leads to 6 rooms and 1 hallway all different, some rooms can lead to other rooms/hallways or be dead ends
Endless dream puzzle - the core puzzle, every time you die, you get sent back to the beginning room, but the clock puzzle doesn't reset, so all progress is reset, there is no pattern nor is there a way to map out where you've been. An endless nightmare adding to the dread of never escaping, of being trapped
True ending puzzle - when one finally escapes there are two endings, the generic ending that is most common, where you wake up in a rubber room with a tally mark noting every time you get this ending, this is the bad ending where you go insane and are confined into a straitjacket, if you retry 10 more times but never get the true ending then tally marks are seen being added every time you enter the cut scene, marking the endless nightmare. The true way to beat the game is still a work in progress but fears and the clock puzzle will play a factor into the true ending
