Ideas to add suspense into the game 
places to hide (making the player wonder what could be chasing them to make them hide, the unknown is a powerful fear)
whispers from behind
loud footsteps from someone in another room
loud noises/shadow movements
eerie music 
PTSD affects (when you have an episode, your ears ring and the more episodes you get the louder it becomes like siren heads noise, this will also drain sanity and open up new ways to die and gain fears)
sudden quiet
