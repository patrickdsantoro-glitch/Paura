Main Ideas for the game
The purpose of the idea is to showcase how strong fear is, the effect it can have, how one with a fear reacts with that fear to make people more understanding of ones phobia, and to induce fear in the hopes that at the end they can overcome a fear or understand someone else who is having a panic attack, interacts with their fear and has a harsh reaction or other like symptoms
The way I want to accomplish this desired affect is by studying and implementing the ways one interacts with a given phobia, how one with PTSD, panic/anxiety attacks or one who gets overwhelmed reacts for the most detailed and realistic game play. This does come with the side effect of terrifying young kids or causing those prone to panic attacks to have an episode, while that is kind of intended, the game isn't meant to harm but instead share and for those who like horror, feel pure terror at this world of nightmare
